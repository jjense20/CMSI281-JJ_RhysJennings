Homework01 Evaluation
======================
For the HighArray.java source file, be sure to use good coding practices to
make your code pretty, artful, and maintainable.  You can copy and paste the
source code from the text book, which will make your life easier, but you
will need to reformat it since copying from a PDF will remove all of the
indenting from the text.

You must add a "getMax()" method to the HighArray.java file, which returns
the largest "key" [another word for "value"] in the array.  You must also
add a "noDups()" method which will scan through the array elements to find
and remove any duplicated values.  For example, in the array that contains
"33 33 33 44 44 55 55 66" the result should be "33 44 55 66".

For the HighArrayApp.java file do it the same way, by copying the contents
from the book and re-formatting.  NOTE THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE – don't
include this code in the same class file as "HighArray.java", the way it is
in the textbook.

Submit both your source code files to your repo.  You only need to submit
the source files, NOT THE CLASS FILES.  THERE MUST BE TWO JAVA SOURCE FILES
IN YOUR REPO FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT.

I have mentioned in class that it is a good idea to have a small "header"
section in your files.  If you elect to include that in this assignment,
you will get two extra credit points.

There are a total of 20 points for this assignment as shown below.  If you
get extra credit it is possible to get more than 100% for the assignment.

Comments:

REALLY nice work on this ~ the output looks great and the multiple tests of
all the functionality, with the prompts for the user, is very professional!

The optional file header was done on one file, so one EC point...

Nice work!
