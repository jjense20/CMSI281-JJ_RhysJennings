Homework03 Evaluation
======================
You MUST do problem 1, the "odd-even sort"

You MUST do EITHER problem 2, Huffman, OR problem 3, Simon.
Whichever one you choose is your option, but you must indicate
which one you choose.  If you want to do both of them, you will
be given extra credit for whatever points you get correct on
the second problem.  For example, if you choose to do Simon and
it is completely correct, and you do Huffman for extra credit
and get 5 out of 7 correct, you will get 136% for the assignment.
The extra points will be applied at the end of the semester to
improve your overall score for the course.

Assuming odd-even sort is correct, of course....

Total credit is 14 for Sorter and either Simon or Huffman
   extra credit is 7 points for other of Simon or Huffman
-------------------------
 Grand total is 21 points for all three

You earned:

you got 19.5 out of 14 which is 139.29% which is an A-plus

EXCELLENT JOB on this assignment!

The sorting program works great.

Your Simon game works very well!  "Need to work on your memory there...
               Come back when you're ready for more action!"

LOLZ!!  ....and the Jeopardy theme song....  HAHAHAHAHA!!!!

The two things to consider with Simon are: 1) you didn't ask if I want to
play again, which was a requirement, and you don't erase the user entry each
time, making it easier to cheat.  Oh, and it's supposed to keep the same
letter sequence each time and just add one letter, instead of generating an
entirely new sequence with each trial.

Hmmm... OK, that's three things....

Huffman works PERFECTLY!!  I know how hard you guys worked on that, and it
paid off ~~ GREAT work on a very difficult problem.

All in all, a worthy effort!  Keep up the good work!!
